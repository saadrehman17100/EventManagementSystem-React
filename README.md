**Event Management System**

**Overview**
The Event Management System is a web application developed using React for the frontend, JavaScript (.js) and TypeScript (.tsx) for frontend and backend, and MySQL for the database. This system is designed to facilitate the management of events, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete events.

**Project Structure**
The project is organized into three main folders:

**1. backend:** Contains the server-side code responsible for handling API requests, interacting with the database, and managing the business logic of the application.

**2. frontend:** Houses the client-side code developed in React. This folder includes components, styles, and other assets related to the user interface.

**3. mysql.sql:** Includes the MySQL script to set up the database schema and initial data for the Event Management System.

**Installation**
Follow these steps to set up and run the Event Management System locally:
